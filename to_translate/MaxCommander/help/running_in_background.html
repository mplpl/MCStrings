<h1>Running operations in background</h1>

All the operations that run using a single job are started in foreground and block the MaxCommander window until they complete. When this happens, the operation displays the Progress Dialog in which you can watch how it progresses. You can also decide to continue the operation in background, by clicking a button with "+" sign (it is displayed on the right to the progress bar). If there is no such button, the given operation cannot run in background.

<br/><br/>

When an operation runs in background it does not block the MaxCommander window and you can use it for browsing or starting other operations. The progress of such operation can be tracked in the Operation Manager.

<br/><br/>

All the operations that run with multiple jobs go to background automatically.

<br/><br/>

Using background operations with FTP/SFTP servers may be <a href="multiple_connections.html">limited</a> by the server provider.
