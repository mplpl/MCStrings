<h1>Deleting items</h1>

To delete a set of items, select them and press <key>Command + 8</key> (or <key>Backspace</key> or <key>Delete</key>). After confirmation, a delete operation will start. The operation can be <a href="running_in_background.html">handled in background</a> or with using <a href="multi_jobs.html">multiple jobs</a>. The latter is not allowed for deleting from archives.

<br/><br/>

If delete is requested for items on the local drives (not in an archive or remote file server) you can also decide if the items should be moved to a trash or deleted permanently. The default behavior can be set in “Settings” menu using “Move to Trash by Default” item.

<br/><br/>

The content of the other panel is not important for this operation.


<h3>Alternative invocation</h3>

You can also request this operation by pressing a button on the Button Bar or the Touch Bar or selecting an item from the top menu.
