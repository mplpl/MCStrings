<h1>Using function keys</h1>

Traditional dual-panel file managers on other platform extensively use function keys to start their major file operations. Like most other computers, Macs have <key>F1</key> – <key>F12</key> function keys on their keyboards, but unlike others, most of them are assigned to specific functions. So that for example pressing <key>F2</key> is not send to an app that is running but is interpreted on the operating system level. This behavior can be changed in System Preferences in Keyboard applet. By we DO NOT recommend this. Instead, all the function keys are mapped to <key>Command + n</key> combination in the MaxCommander app, when n is a function key number (for example, <key>Command + 8</key> is the same as <key>F8</key>) – this works for all Macs and their keyboards without any reconfiguration required. And the buttons on the Button Bar are labels with that shortcuts.

Macs with keyboards equipped with the Touch Bar, can use function keys by pressing <key>fn</key> key. That make the Touch Bar display function keys that can then be tapped.
