<h1>Copying and moving items</h1>

<h3>Copying</h3>

Copying is the most common file operation in the MaxCommander app. To run it, select the destination forder in one panel, then go to the other panel, select all the items you want to copy and press <key>Command + 5</key>. This will open the Copy Dialog where you should confirm the operation. You can also set <a href="multi_jobs.html">number of jobs</a>. After pressing ‘OK’ button the operation starts. You can then set the operation to <a href="running_in_background.html">run in background</a>.

<br/><br/>

The copy operation can run on local items, archived item, items on remote file systems or their combination (like for example copying from a local file system to an existing archive).

<h3>Copying to subfolder</h3>

If you want to copy to a subfolder of the current folder set in the target panel, use ‘To’ field from the Copy Dialog. By default, it is set to the current folder of the target panel. You can change it by appending the name of subfolder to copy to. If it does not exist, it will be created. For instance, adding ‘fun/pictures’ at the end of the path in ‘To’ will copy to ‘fun/pictures’ subfolder that will be creeate if needed.

<h3>Copying with rename</h3>
    
When there is just one item selected for the copy operation (could be a file or folder) and destination is not a folder or does not exist at all, the copy operation will use the last component of the destination path as expected target item name (not folder into which the item needs to be copied). That allows you to clone an item with a new name.

<h3>Moving</h3>

Moving is like copying, but with removing from the source all the items copied to the destination. You can move to a subfolder or move with rename in a similar way as for the copy operation.

<h3>Alternative invocation</h3>

You can also request these operations by pressing a button on the Button Bar or the Touch Bar, selecting an item from the top menu, using <a href="drag_and_drop.html">drag and drop</a> and using <a href="copy_and_paste.html">copy & paste</a>.
