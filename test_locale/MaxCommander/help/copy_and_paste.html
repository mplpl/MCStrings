<h1>Using copy and paste for copying items</h1>

Using copy & paste for copying items is similar to drag and drop but you donâ€™t have to drag. You just select items and press <key>Command + c</key> in Finder and then <key>Command + p</key> in the MaxCommander app to past (copy items) into the current folder of the current panel in the app.

<br/><br/>

For the local file system items, this function also works in the other direction (selecting items in the MaxCommander with <key>Command + c</key> and paste into the Finder with <key>Command + p</key>) as well as between panels in the MaxCommander window (selecting items in the first panel in the MaxCommander, then <key>Command + c</key>, then change the panel with <key>Tab</key>, and <key>Command + p</key>).
