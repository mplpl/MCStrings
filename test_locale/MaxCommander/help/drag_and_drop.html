<h1>Using drag and drop</h1>

Drag and drop from an app to the MaxCommander works for local drives as well as for archived and remote file servers.

<br/><br/>

Drag and drop from the MaxCommander is fully supported for local files. When dragging a file that is in an archive or on remote server, the target (the app to which you drag) needs to support the mechanism of ‘file promises’ – the Finder supports it, but lot of other apps does not. To handle such apps, you need to first get the file into a local cache (that will unpack or download it) by previewing it with Quick Look (press <key>Space</key>) and only then drag and drop it to the target app.

<br/><br/>
Drag and drop also works between panels of the MaxCommander window.

<br/><br/>
The operation performed during drag and drop can be copy or move. When the items are dropped into the other folder of the same device they are stored, the default operation is usually move. To switch to copy operation, press <key>Option</key> key while dragging. When you do that, the icon will change into a "+" sign to show that the copy operation will be performed. Now drop the items to the target (without releasing <key>Option</key> key) and they will be copied.
