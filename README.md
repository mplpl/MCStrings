# MCStrings

This repo contains strings and other localizable content (like HTML pages with the help) of MaxCommander project. Currently, the files come from version 2.1.

If you want to translate it to a new language, create a top-level directory indicating that locale (for instance 'fr' for French) and copy there all the files from the 'to_translate' folder. Next, translate all these files and commit/push them back to this repo.

Please note, that all the files in this repo, including the files that you add, are covered by MIT license which allows them to be used in commercial products without any liability or payment to whoever added or modified them.
